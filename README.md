Meme Generator Capstone Project in React for Scrimba course

## What?
For the Scrimba Learn React capstone project, we created a meme generator using class-based components. I want to re-create the same generator but using **functional components** instead to continue furthering my understanding of useState and useEffect.

Course: https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact

## What I did & learned
- I converted the components from class-based to functional
    - I developed a better understanding of the syntax of class and functional components
    - I furthered my understanding of useState() and useEffect()
- I used useEffect() to **fetch data from an API** (the meme images)
- I used this as an opportunity to improve my **CSS skills** because the CSS styling was provided during the course. 
    - I practiced making the website responsive by using *vw* sizes
    - I practiced my CSS *positioning* by placing the 'meme' text on the top and bottom of the image
    - I practiced using *child selectors* (>) to simplify the CSS
